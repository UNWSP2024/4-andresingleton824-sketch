# Program #3: Average Rainfall
# Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average 
# rainfall over a period of years.  
# The program should first ask for the number of years.  
# The outer loop will iterate once for each year. 
# The inner loop will iterate twelve times, once for each month.  
# Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for inches of rainfall for each month.  
# After all iterations, the program should display the number of months, 
# the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.

def main():
    total_rainfall = 0.0

    years = int(input("Enter the number of years: "))

    for year in range(1, years + 1):
        print(f"Year {year}")
        for month in range(1, 13):
            rainfall = float(input(f"  Enter rainfall for month {month}: "))
            total_rainfall += rainfall

    total_months = years * 12
    average_rainfall = total_rainfall / total_months
